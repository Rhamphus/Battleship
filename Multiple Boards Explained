  // this part of the code is the part you need for multiple boards. First you need a variable with numbers, which has to be a
  number that is lower than 1 and higher than 0, that's why I choose Math.Random(). You will need to have a number that has no
  numbers after the ' , ' so you need to floor that number, and multiply it by the number of gameboards available. This part has to
  be between brackets, since it has to be produced before you apply the Math.floor(). When finally number '3' comes out, it will 
  play the fourth gameboard. Be careful: All the gameboards you apply should have the same name! You also need to multiply the
  Math.random() by the number of gameboards you created, and not standard by 5!
